The assignment source code consists of:
1. preprocess_dataset.cpp (this outputs text file dataset_preprocessed.txt)
2. probability calculation.cpp (this outputs text file counts.txt)
3. anagram.cpp (this is the main file which outputs top k anagrams)

The following are the internet open source references that I have 
used to help me complete the assignment logically and also some for
implementing the helper functions.
